; Code Snippet 1: Addition
Assume memory locations for operands and result:
; Memory location 0x10: Operand1
; Memory location 0x20: Operand2
; Memory location 0x30: Result
; Load operand1 into ACC (Accumulator)
LOAD 0x10
; Add operand2 to ACC
ADD 0x20
; Store the result back to memory
STORE 0x30
; Code Snippet 2: Product of Two Numbers
Assume memory locations for operands and result:
; Memory location 0x80: Operand1
; Memory location 0x81: Operand2
; Memory location 0x90: Result
; Load the first operand into ACC
LOAD 0x80
; Multiply ACC by the second operand
MUL 0x81
; Store the result back to memory
STORE 0x90
